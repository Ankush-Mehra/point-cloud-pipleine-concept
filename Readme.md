# Point Cloud Processing Pipeline

This project demonstrates a LiDAR point cloud processing pipeline with visualization, filtering, ground separation, clustering, and bounding box generation.  
Everything shown here is unoptimized and for **demonstration purposes only**.

## üñºÔ∏è Pipeline Overview

### 1. Visualization with Reflectance  
Reflectance values are mapped to the **red channel** for visual clarity.

### 2. Filtering by Reflectivity Threshold  
Low-reflectivity points are filtered out.

### 3. Ground Separation (RANSAC)  
Ground points are removed using **RANSAC plane fitting**.

### 4. Clustering with DBSCAN  
Objects are clustered using **DBSCAN**.

### 5. Axis-Aligned Bounding Boxes  
Bounding boxes are generated around each cluster.
